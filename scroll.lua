---
--- Sets a cb_func callback function for event, passing cb_data data to

---
--- event can be:
---
--- view events: cb_func is a Lua function with two parameters, view

--- creating the callback.
---
---   "view_map": application's window creation.
---   "view_unmap": right before an application's window destruction.
---   "view_urgent": a window gets the urgent attribute set.
---   "view_focus": a window gets focus.
---   "view_float" a window becomes floating or goes back to tiled.
---
--- workspace events: cb_func is Lua function with two parameters, workspace
--- (the workspace triggering the event) and  data , the  cb_data  value passed
--- when creating the callback.
---
---   "workspace_create": called when a workspace is created.
---   "workspace_focus": called when focusing a workspace.
---
--- ipc events:
---
---   "ipc_view": called every time an IPC event for a window happens. cb_func
---     is Lua function with three parameters: view  (the view triggering the event),
---     change (a string with the event name), and data, the cb_data value
---     passed when creating the callback.
---   "ipc_workspace": called every time an IPC event for a workspace happens.
---     cb_func is Lua function with four parameters: old_ws (the old workspace),
---     new_ws (the new workspace), change (a string with the event name), and
---     data, the cb_data value	passed when creating the callback.
---
--- cb_data can be any Lua variable, including a table with multiple values.

--- Returns the canonical data of the space template saved under `name`
--- (see the `space_template save` command) as a plain table: version,

---
--- On failure (an unsafe or unknown name, a corrupt file, ...) returns
--- nil plus an error string.

---
--- @return table|nil
--- @return string|nil error
function scroll.space_template_get(name) end

---
--- Binds every slot of the space template saved under `name` to a live
--- window and applies it to the current workspace in one step: layout,
--- split fractions, floating geometry, scroller settings, and focus. Any
--- window already on the workspace that isn't part of the apply is moved
--- to the scratchpad, never closed.
---
--- `mappings` is an array of tables, each either `{ slot = "editor",
--- con_id = 3 }` (an explicit container id, e.g. from
--- `scroll.container_get_id(container)`) or `{ slot = "editor", criteria
--- = '[app_id="foot"]' }` (a criteria string as used in the config
--- language; it must match exactly one window with a mapped view).
---
--- This function does no matching, launching, filling, retrying, or
--- fallback selection on its own -- it only resolves the mapping the
--- caller already decided on. Every slot must resolve to exactly one live
--- window or nothing is changed: on failure this returns nil, an error
--- string, and (when the failure names specific slots) an array of the
--- affected slot names, so a script can launch/raise a default for each
--- one and call this function again. See
--- examples/space-templates/fill-then-retry.lua and
--- examples/space-templates/launcher-placeholders.lua.
